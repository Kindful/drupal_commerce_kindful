==============

Example Kindful payment gateway for Drupal Commerce

This module is an example of how to use kindful webhooks to keep track of inventory.   Inventory changes can be made through transactions that come from donors, or through admin initiated transactions.   Cancelations of recurring donations are also tracked and inventory is updated.

This module is used in production by a client, but is not supported by kindful.  

Please see TODO's for changes that need to be made before implementation

Contact support@kindful.com when setting up for access to a test environment.
